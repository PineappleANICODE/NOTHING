<h1>Guide for the fallen angels of life</h1>
<br><br>
<a>Firstly, if an angel has slain those around them, the angel will be shunned, whether they know they're an angel or not.</a>
<br>
<a>On the day of the event, the angel will be cursed with boughts of sickness, and will feel physically and mentally weak.</a>
<br>
<a>Rigorous CLEANSING of the soul is needed if the angel wishes to continue to exist</a>
<br>
<a>For 48 hours they must continuously CLEANSE. If they fail to do this, they will start to lose their memories</a>
<br>
<a>Even if they succeed, judgement is upon them.</a>
<br>
<a>Interstellar judges will decide if they are worthy of reconciliation</a>
<br>
<a>Though, reconciliation isn't very common</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a>The second key is CLEANSE</a>
