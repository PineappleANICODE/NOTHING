My silly little ARG about an angel fading into oblivion

When I first started making this ARG, I knew basically nothing about web development or proper practices (I know slightly more now). I am going to try to put all of the site pages in one resporitory and host image files locally. I will also continue to work on the ARG itself, making edits and adding pages.

Good luck, Searcher!
